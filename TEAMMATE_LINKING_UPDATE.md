# Teammate Linking Update

## Overview
Updated the Eagle Match app to properly link teammates by email/phone number instead of just names, enabling proper account linkage and partnership tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Updated `matches` table to use `teammate_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)` instead of `teammate TEXT`
- ✅ Created migration script (`migrate_teammate_linking.sql`) to handle existing data
- ✅ Partnerships table already configured for proper teammate ID linking

### 2. Create Screen (`lib/screens/tabs/create_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Enhanced teammate search to look up by email, phone, or name
- ✅ Added visual feedback when teammate is successfully linked
- ✅ Updated UI text to clearly explain the linking process
- ✅ Added "LINKED" status indicator for selected teammates
- ✅ Improved validation messages for teammate selection
- ✅ Better error handling with user feedback

### 3. Matches Screen (`lib/screens/tabs/matches_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Updated query to join with teammate profile data
- ✅ Fixed display of teammate information using joined profile data
- ✅ Now shows teammate full name instead of old text field

### 4. Find Screen (`lib/screens/tabs/find_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Updated query to include teammate profile join
- ✅ Fixed teammate display to use proper profile data

## How It Works

### Teammate Selection Process
1. User selects "Duo" match mode in create screen
2. User types email, phone, or name in teammate search field (minimum 3 characters)
3. System searches `profiles` table for matching registered users
4. User selects from dropdown of found profiles
5. Selected teammate is linked by their profile ID
6. Visual confirmation shows "LINKED" status

### Database Integration
- Teammate searches query: `profiles.email`, `profiles.phone`, and `profiles.full_name`
- Match creation stores `teammate_id` (UUID) reference to `profiles.id`
- Match displays join with teammate profile data for proper name/info display
- Partnership tracking uses teammate IDs for accurate duo statistics

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear instructions: "Search by email, phone number, or name to find and link teammate accounts"
- Visual feedback when teammate is selected
- "LINKED" status badge showing successful account connection
- Better error messages for missing teammate selection
- Dropdown shows full name, email, and phone for easy identification

## Benefits
1. **Account Linking**: Teammates are properly linked to their Eagle Match accounts
2. **Partnership Tracking**: Accurate duo statistics and partnership history
3. **Data Integrity**: No more duplicate or incorrect teammate entries
4. **User Experience**: Clear search and selection process
5. **Security**: Only registered users can be selected as teammates

## Next Steps
1. Run database migration script if not already done
2. Test teammate selection flow
3. Verify partnership creation works with new teammate linking
4. Consider dropping old `teammate` column after migration verification
