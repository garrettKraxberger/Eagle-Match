# USGA-Inspired UI Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive USGA-style UI implementation for the Eagle Match app, making it closely resemble the official USGA website (https://www.usga.org/).

## Design System Overview

### Color Palette
Based on the USGA website analysis, we've implemented:

- **Accent Gold**: `#D4AF37` - USGA's distinctive gold color
- **Background White**: `#FAFAFA` - Clean off-white background
- **Card White**: `#FFFFFF` - Pure white for cards and containers
- **Text Colors**: Navy-based hierarchy for professional look

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter - Clean, professional typeface matching USGA's modern approach
- **Text Hierarchy**: Consistent sizing from headlines (32px) to body text (14px)
